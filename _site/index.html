<p>The purpose of this website is to share my UX journey with you. I discovered the UX world my sophomore year of college, more specifically in the fall semester of the 2019-2020 school year. I took a class called INF 130 - Research and Design for Informatics. One can consider this class an intro class to UX. This class started off with learning concepts &amp; methodologies in UX to producing an mobile app prototype on InVision. My partner &amp; I created an app called Self Wind. We built this app prototype specifically for college students with focus on time management &amp; self care habits. After taking that class, it has been life changing for me as I would love to pursue a career in UX.</p>

<p><strong>Checkout the final project my partner &amp; I did for the INF 130 class!</strong></p>

<h2 id="about-me"><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Hello there, I’m Monica!</strong> I started my college journey at Dominican University in August 2018. Originally, I came to DU unsure of what I wanted to study and pursue as a career. I decided to play my first year safely by taking my general education (gen ed) courses to get those requirements out of the way. One day, I met my class/friend, Leslie, who introduced me to the informatics major. My first question to her was “What is Informatics?” She explained it to me as “It’s sort of like computer science, but less programming and more focused on problem solving and dealing with people.” At that instant, I was very intrigued and she caught my attention. As time went on, I took more informatics classes and eventually declared myself as an informatics major. I took one informatics class called INF 130: Research and Design for Informatics and taking this class has made me discover the UX field. In this class I learned about UX concepts and implementing those concepts into a half semester project where I worked with a partner and built an app prototype solving a real world problem.</p>

<h4>A/B Testing</h4>
<p>A/B testing is a method of UX research. A/B testing, also known as split testing, consists of a randomized experiment with 2 variants which are A and B. It is the process of showing 2 variants and compares 2 versions of something to figure out which performs better.

<h4>UX Surveys</h4>
<p>UX surveys are a great way to get data, especially when you’re on a short timeframe and need data quickly. The purpose of UX surveys are to gather as much data from as many of your users as possible typically in a short timeframe. UX surveys is the way to go when it comes to collecting data fast.

<h4>Usability Testing</h4>
<p>Usability testing is one of the many user research methods used by researchers to get some insight on a product. The main goals in usability testing are identifying problems, uncovering opportunities, and learning about the target users.

<h4>User Interviews</h4>
<p>User interviews can be extremely valuable in the UX design process in certain cases. The purpose of one-on-one interviews is for the researcher and user or stakeholder to communicate and conversate about the product or service. I personally think one-on-one interviews are interesting because you can ask lots of questions to your user and can get answers right then and there versus a survey where it’s more data collecting rather than connecting and being empathetic to your users.

<h4>User Research</h4>
<p>User experience research is the investigation of your users in order to gather information that will help the design process of a project. The purpose of user research is to put your design project into context. Are you creating a mobile app or website? You need feedback from users on what does and what doesn’t work for them for your design project to make it as efficient to your users as possible.

Some of the user research methods that will be covered include: surveys, interviews, A/B testing, usability testing.

<h4>UX Design vs. UI Design</h4>
<p>UX Design &amp; UI Design may sound and seem very similar, but they are actually quite different. UX design involves more of the users experience meanwhile UI design focuses more on the visuals (colors, typography, etc.) of an interface or a product or service.

<h4>UX Design</h4>
<p>What is user experience (UX) design? UX design is a person’s interaction with a product or service and it can be anything from something physical like a coffee maker to something more digital like a website or mobile app. The purpose of UX design is to innovate products that already exist or create entirely new ones to make users’ interactions with products and services useful, easy to use or user-friendly, and delightful to interact with.
