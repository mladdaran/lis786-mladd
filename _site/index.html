<p>The purpose of this website is to share my UX journey with you. I discovered the UX world my sophomore year of college in the fall semester of the 2019-2020 school year. I took a class with professor Donald (Don) Hamerly called INF 130 - Research and Design for Informatics. One can consider this class an intro class to UX. This class started off with learning concepts &amp; methodologies in UX. From choosing a topic and conducting user research (through surveys, interviews, etc.) to producing an mobile app prototype on InVision. My partner (Lourdes Fernandez) &amp; I created an app called Self Wind, where we focus on time management &amp; self care.</p>

<p><strong>Checkout the final project my partner &amp; I did for the INF 130 class!</strong></p>

<h2 id="about-me"><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Hello there, I’m Monica!</strong> I started my college journey at Dominican University in August 2018. Originally, I came to DU unsure of what I wanted to study and pursue as a career. I decided to play my first year safely by taking my gen ed courses to get those requirements out of the way. One day, I met my class/friend, Leslie, who introduced me to the informatics major. My first question to her was “What is Informatics?” She explained it to me as “It’s sort of like computer science, but less programming and more focused on problem solving and dealing with people.” At that instant, I was very intrigued and she caught my attention. As time went on, I took more informatics classes and eventually declared myself as an informatics major. I took one informatics class called INF 130: Research and Design for Informatics and taking this class has made me discover the UX field. In this class I learned about UX concepts and implementing those concepts into a half semester project where I worked with a partner and built an app prototype solving a real world problem.</p>

<p>Browse the topics below:</p>

<h2>Prototyping</h2>
<p>This is my definition of prototyping. Prototyping is a process where ideas are transformed into solutions (from paper to digital). What I mean by solutions are design solutions, so it can be changing the location of a button on a coffee maker or mobile app to changing the functionality of something.

<h2>User Research</h2>
<p>User experience research is the investigation of your users in order to gather information that will help the design process of a project. The purpose of user research is to put your design project into context. Are you creating a mobile app or website? You need feedback from users on what does and what doesn’t work for them for your design project.

Ways in which you can conduct user research is through surveys, polls, interviews, etc.
