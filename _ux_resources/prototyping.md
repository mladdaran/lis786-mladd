**Prototyping is a process where ideas are transformed into solutions (from paper to digital).** What I mean by solutions are design solutions, so it can be changing the location of a button on a coffee maker or mobile app to changing the functionality of something. You can start the prototyping process by simply creating a paper prototype and work your way up to a digital prototype where you can make it interactive for your users.
