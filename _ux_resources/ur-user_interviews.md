**User interviews can be extremely valuable in the UX design process in certain cases.** The purpose of one-on-one interviews is for the researcher and user or stakeholder to communicate and conversate about the product or service. I personally think one-on-one interviews are interesting because you can ask lots of questions to your user and can get answers right then and there versus a survey where it's more data collecting rather than connecting and being empathetic to your users.
