**User experience research is the investigation of your users in order to gather information that will help the design process of a project.** The purpose of user research is to put your design project into context. Are you creating a mobile app or website? You need feedback from users on what does and what doesn't work for them for your design project.

Ways in which you can conduct user research is through surveys, polls, interviews, etc.
