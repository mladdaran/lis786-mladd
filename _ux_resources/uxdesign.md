**What is user experience (UX) design? UX design is a person's interaction with a product or service and it can be anything from something physical like a coffee maker to something more digital like a website or mobile app.** The purpose of UX design is to innovate products that already exist or create entirely new ones to make users' interactions with products and services useful, easy to use or user-friendly, and delightful to interact with.
