### **My College Journey**
**Hello there, I'm Monica!** I started my college journey at Dominican University in August 2018. Originally, I came to DU unsure of what I wanted to study and pursue as a career. I decided to play my first year safely by taking my general education courses to get those requirements out of the way. One day, I met my class/friend, Leslie, who introduced me to the informatics major. My first question to her was "What is Informatics?" She explained it to me as "It's sort of like computer science, but less programming and more focused on problem solving and dealing with people." At that instant, I was very intrigued and she caught my attention. As time went on, I took more informatics classes and eventually declared myself as an informatics major. I took one informatics class called INF 130: Research and Design for Informatics and taking this class has made me discover the UX field. In this class I learned about UX concepts and implementing those concepts into a half semester project where I worked with a partner and built an app prototype solving a real world problem.

### **The Moment I Discovered UX**
I discovered UX in a class I took my sophomore year (2019-2020 school year). I took a class called **INF 130: Research and Design for Informatics.** This was the best class I ever took at my school because it made my dreams possible. I knew I wanted to pursue a career in technology because tech isn't going anywhere anytime soon, but I needed to pursue a career that was also a creative outlet for me. For me, I view UX design as a way to help people with the help of technology to create meaningful & life changing experiences for people.

### **Where I Am RIGHT NOW!!!**
I am currently a junior-standing Dominican University student and close to the end of my junior year. I recently started using this website/app called Notion and it helps me organize school life as well as my personal life. I am also figuring out what I want to do with my life: what job I want to get after I graduate (UX designer & researcher or mentor/academic advisor), what company I want to work for (corporate or non-profit), thinking if I want to go to graduate/grad school or not, etc.

I will be busy this summer taking 2 summer classes at Wilbur Wright, working for my TRIO Ambassador job at Dominican, and I plan to start my summer internship at a startup called [Seedstages](https://seedstages.com/) soon after this semester ends. I also plan to have fun because life is too short & I need some fun since Iâ€™ve been busy with school and work all semester long.
