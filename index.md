## **Hello there, I'm Monica!**
# **<center>Welcome to my UX Journey!</center>**

*You can find resources on learning about the UX Basics as well as some tips & tricks for starting your career in UX.*

The purpose of this website is to share my UX journey with you. I discovered the UX world my sophomore year of college in the fall semester of the 2019-2020 school year. I took a class with professor Donald (Don) Hamerly called INF 130 - Research and Design for Informatics. One can consider this class an intro class to UX. This class started off with learning concepts & methodologies in UX. From choosing a topic and conducting user research (through surveys, interviews, etc.) to producing an mobile app prototype on InVision. My partner (Lourdes Fernandez) & I created an app called Self Wind, where we focus on time management & self care.

**Checkout the final project my partner & I did for the INF 130 class!**
